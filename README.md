# things
the number of things in the universe

We should probably write a real readme at some point...

Here's the function to save the data in the right format:
np.savetxt('fileName.txt',data,fmt='%1.3e \t',header='M (M_s) \t dN/dMdV (M_s^-1 pc^-3)')

To plot your line just add the filename to the list, plus a colour, a string for the label and a label position
(sounds complex but should be pretty clear in the file)

Feel free to pull request if you feel comfortable with it (even if not! I'm overseeing everything so you shouldn't be able to break anything and now's a good time to learn)
Otherwise you can always just make your data and email it to me.

Not sure how to share a link to the sharelatex document but if we work that out I'll post that here too.

Happy hunting!
